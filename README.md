### About Me
Hi, my name is Jared Thompson. I enjoy going on hikes, watching sports, playing golf and crunching numbers. I enjoyed them so much so that I even went to school to study statistics. I graduated from Wright State University in the spring of 2023. The overwhelming reaction when telling people I studies statistics... "Ewww!" I realize data and math are not for everyone but it is one of my passions. I have dedicated this page to demonstrating my skills and the journey in aquiring new ones along the way. I hope in the long run I am able to build a wide ranging portfolio that clearly exemplifies my aptitude in Excel, SQL, Python, R and Tableau. I know I am not perfect and have a lot to learn but I am hoping this page is the beginning of many possibilities.
